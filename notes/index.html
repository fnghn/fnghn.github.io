    <h1>How to study mathematics</h1>
    <p> This piece is aimed at those who are studying pure mathematics at a university level (enrolled or not). It's made up mainly of collected wisdom from the internet. There is a lot of information available on self-teaching applied topics (for instance, for programmers and data scientists), but it seems hard to penetrate to advice that is both practical and applicable. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t panic.</li>
      <li>3-4 hours a day is more than enough.</li>
      <li>There is never harm in doing more problems.</li>
      <li>With regular attention to a topic and plenty of time, the heavy lifting is done far from the desk.</li>
      <li>Mixing problem difficulties is a good idea; scale up in difficulty. Don’t start with the exams, and don’t be afraid to start with trivial problems.</li>
      <li>Intuition is momentary and slippy. Practice helps; remain conscious of your approach. A good way to do this is to take notes on your personal heuristics.</li>
      <li>Understanding in the abstract is not the same as intuition in formalisation and proof.</li>
        <ul><li>If you have a question, try to form a conjecture, and prove it yourself. Understanding isn’t enough to work with them and create an interesting result with ease.</li></ul>
      <li>When learning theorems and definitions, read (aloud or word by word) several times:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>First, try to understand the general point.</li>
        <li>Then try to recall the definitions and details.</li>
        <li>Work on fluency of definitions and what they entail; try to recall a theorem’s proof.</li>
        <li>When truly fluent, alter the conditions of theorems and see what happens.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Advisable textbooks:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Herstein’s Topics in Algebra (putting this here because I have it on hand)</li>
        <li>Papy’s Groups (also on hand)</li>
        <li>Spivak’s Calculus</li>
        <li>Velleman's How to Prove It</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Following a textbook is, in one way, like reading a novel. Of course, the mathematical context and background facts provided at the beginning of a book or chapter are important to understand what happens next. But some details provided at the beginning may, either intentionally or just because of your own mental modelling, only begin to make sense once the topic is explained in greater detail, or additional material is related thereto.</li>
